## Redesigning Aave’s Governance Platform

Tozer Labs received a grant from the Aave Grants DAO to reimagine Aave’s governance experience and deliver a complete design prototype for a refreshed governance platform.

We partnered with an associate graphic designer to produce a full UI rethink with custom graphics throughout. The concept drew inspiration from platforms like Tally, Boardroom, and other leading governance tooling, while tailoring the experience to Aave’s community and workflow. The result was a polished set of designs delivered ahead of schedule and within the agreed scope.

After the prototype was delivered, Aave Grants decided not to move the work into production.
