## Web3Geography

We collected **60,000+** web3 job postings, more than **6×** the original target.

Tozer Labs (formerly Wizzy Wig Web3) received a multi-year grant from the Solana Foundation to build **Web3Geography**, a public data and research initiative focused on where web3 work happens. The project scraped and open-sourced job location data, transforming it into dashboards and reports that surfaced trends across geography, company size, and in-demand skills.

### What we delivered
- Open-sourced, multi-year dataset of web3 job postings  
- **Phase 1** report with key insights and a public Grafana dashboard  
- **Phase 2** interactive report with dashboards and charts, published publicly alongside a launch blog post  
- Ongoing maintenance to keep the dashboard live and accessible after release
